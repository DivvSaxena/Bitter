# Bitter - Twitter Clone Project 


Welcome to the Twitter Clone project! After two days of continuous development,I am excited to present the first version of our Twitter clone. In this web application, you can create tweets, like, and retweet posts, as well as view  comments.

## Features

- **Create Tweets:** You can compose and post your tweets just like on Twitter itself.

- **Like and Retweet:** Show your appreciation for other users' tweets by liking them, or share them with your followers by retweeting.

- **View Comments:** Dive into the conversations happening around tweets by viewing and interacting with comments.

- **Local Tweet Storage (Coming Soon):** Your tweets are stored locally in your browser, so you can revisit them even after closing the application.

- **Reply and Delete (Coming Soon):** We are actively working on adding the ability to reply to specific tweets and delete your own tweets. Stay tuned for updates!

## Tech Stacks

Our Twitter Clone is built using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript:** The core functionality of the application is powered by JavaScript.

- **HTML:** The structure of the web pages is created using HTML.

- **CSS:** CSS is used to style the application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to learn and implement various concepts and techniques, including:

- **UUIDs:** Universally Unique Identifiers are used to uniquely identify tweets and other elements in the application.

- **CDN:** Content Delivery Networks are used to efficiently load external libraries and resources.

- **forEach():** I used the forEach() method to iterate over arrays and collections, enabling dynamic data handling.

- **Conditionally Render Styles:** The application utilizes conditional rendering of styles to provide a responsive and interactive user experience.
